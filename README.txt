Hi,

I've supplied some runnable code, to run it open code_sample.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks and run it to install requirements. I use MacOSX so this may cause some issues in some packages.
If you just want to see the outcome of the code, I have supplied the html of the Jupiter notebook run on my computer in 'code_sample.html'.

Contact me for any questions or assistance at:
Tsmod@outlook.com

Thanks!
